**GrasshopperChallenges** are a set of challenges *designed* to teach Grasshopper, by creating a set of active learning / problem-solving challenges. The challenges are designed to be fun, and also to highly limit the scope of each problem, so that learners can tackle one aspect of Grasshopper at a time.

**Grasshopper挑战** 是一组为GH教学设计的挑战，旨在创造一组积极学习/问题解决式的挑战。这些挑战的设计很有趣，并限制了问题的复杂性，因此初学者可以一次解决GH的一小部分。
